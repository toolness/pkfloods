This is a simple proof-of-concept script provided as one possible
solution to the following problem placed in the CrisisCommons 2010
[Pakistan Floods Wiki][]:

    Get comments from pkfloods facebook group exported vis rss so it can
    be imported into Ushahidi. This is currently not possible in
    Facebook groups so Simon Hilton (simon.hilton@gmail.com) has emailed
    Facebook to see if this can be done.

The code was written on August 27, 2010 during [CrisisCamp Silicon Valley]
at the Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley, NASA Research Campus.
